## Pythia - AI Observability for Reliable Generative AI

Pythia is an AI observability and reliability platform designed to monitor and manage the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-time. It ensures that your generative AI applications are accurate, fair, and trustworthy by detecting issues like hallucinations, bias, explainability gaps, and security vulnerabilities by seamlessly plugging into your existing observability stack.
